# Masonry-Interface-Design
Masonry buildings are one of the most vulnerable buildings to seismic actions, highlighting the need for thorough analysis of their responses to lateral loading. Tremuri is one of the most common softwares in the field of masonry building analysis. However, the program lacks a number of modeling/analysis/recording features that OpenSees software offers. Therefore, one could take quite an advantage of having a model of a masonry building in OpenSees. The main problem is the complexity of masonry model definition in OpenSees. On the other hand, as OpenSees software does not offer any graphical user interface (GUI), modeling complexity is an intrinsic characteristic of it. A GUI capable of importing Tremuri files and generating OpenSees masonry models was developed. The interface was developed during my research stay at EESD lab in EPFL under supervision of Prof. Katrin Beyer and working in conjunction with my colleague Francesco Vanin, as the masonry behavior is modeled using the macroelement defined in OpenSees by Francesco.
